Activity 3: Writing a Project Overview Statement
Select an activity you are planning. Again, you can use the activity you chose in Activity 1 and/or 2, or select a new one. Just make sure it meets the criteria for a project!

Answer the following questions. You may want to write down your answers.

What problem will this activity solve, or what opportunity will it exploit? (You may use your answer from Activity 2.)
What is your project goal?
What is your project objective?
What are your criteria for success?
What assumptions do you bring to this project?
What are the potential risks and obstacles?
Here's an example:

The activity is "taking a course in project management."
The problem is that your employer would like you to take on more management duties, but you don't yet have the experience or knowledge. The opportunity is that your employer will pay for your tuition!
Your goal is: "Complete an online course in project management at the University of Washington by the end of June of this year, with a grade of 3.0 or better, and be able to write a scope definition, a Project Overview Statement, and a Work Breakdown Structure for a project at your workplace."
Your criteria for success are the grade of 3.0 and your ability to show your employer that you can write a scope definition and a POS that will get customer approval, and a Work Breakdown Structure that can be followed by the project team.
Assumptions are that
you have a working computer with a good Internet connection, and you have basic computer skills;
the UW is offering the course you need between now and June of this year;
your employer has budgeted for the tuition and materials;
you have at least 20 hours a week to study and complete assignments.
Risks include
the possibility that your computer could crash during a crucial moment in the course;
the chance of a family emergency taking time away from your studies;
the possibility that you don't have the ability to acquire the skills your employer wants.
